# Anahata ASI Project Tasks

This file tracks the actionable tasks and tactical goals for the Anahata ASI (V2) project.

## 0. Zero Day Go Live: 

- [x] Remove syntax highligthing from java code blocks in text parts.

- [X] WrapLayout in unloadResources plays games with horizotnal widths some times

- [X] Integrate CodeRefiner.optimizeImports in BCR
    
## 2. Post Go Live (v1.1)
- [ ] "add / remove to AGI Context for "files in a jar"  

- [ ] check playback lines on linux work correctly

- [ ] Include part types in Garbage collector logs 

- [ ] ToolCallPanel sometimes shows white sspace between the adjustingtabbedpane and the response titled panel in maven tool calls 

- [ ] make "cached data" in MediaView transient? possibly in text resources too?

- [ ] change all log.info to log.debug

- [ ] merge helders database branch

- [ ] test one hf model with the chat completions api and put (Beta) 



- [ ] **Preferences Panel**: 
    [ ] Enabled / Disabled toolkits

- [ ] **Context Panel**: 
    [ ] prune / remove multiple messages
    [ ] disable multiple toolkits at once

- [ ] **[CORE] Generic "TOO LARGE" Response Handling**: Implement a mechanism to detect when a `JavaMethodToolResponse` (including logs, errors, and result) exceeds a safe token/size threshold. If too large, the status should be set to `TOO_LARGE` and the content truncated or replaced with a summary to prevent context window exhaustion.
- [ ] Rework system instructions to be more natural
- [ ] **ContextPanel**: Still some flickers when i have a node selected in the tree and a resource changes or a message arrives the right hand side disappears

- [ ] **NetBeans Local History File System Integration **:
    - [ ] Local History integration via change messages.
    - [ ] Version Control with line numbers (text based glyph gutter)

- [ ] Metabollic Donut Chart with click in to expand any section to an inner donut chart 

- [ ] **Next-Gen Project Overview/Structure**: 
    Explore UML-like structural representations for Project Structure or including the TreePathHandle or a short version of the extends and implements clauses like e Throwable i so you can include what extends and what implements along with the class level types, check token costs
    Include maven phases similar to mavne action runner nb plugin

- [ ] **Improve Hierarchical Agent Management**:
    - [ ] **Subagent API**: Improve API for the model to spawn subagents with 
            - fine-grained control over `AgiConfig` `RequestConfig` and Tool permissions, 
            - something to approve pending tool calls as well and to simply send messages as the user or a sendContext
            - get the full details of any part or message
            - get the consolidated metadata index or always include it in the rag message of the parent
    - [ ] **Reporting Mechanism**: Implement a way for subagents to report task completion and results back to the "Boss" agent via shared dashboard or messaging system or something like that.
- [ ] convert to diff based update events and add something to 

    

## 3. Post Go Live Go Live (v1.2)
- [ ] **CwQL**: Create a Context Window Query Language spec and implementation. So if the model spawans subagents or wants to peek into saved or disposed sessions. A simple query language can be used like 
        - sessionUUID/history(role=model)/partType=text/thought=false 
        - sessionUUID/tools/RadioTool/selectedPlaybackDevice (to look up the selectedPlaybackDevice field in the RadioTool) 
        - sessionUUID/status or sessionUUID/history/size 
        - disposed/sessionUUID/history/role=model/(matching:'Task completed')
        - remoteContaier/*(all sessions)/history/role=model/(matching:'Task completed')
        - or anything that would allow the ASI to surgically check what other agents are doing or what is in the saved or dispossed sessions dir (infinte memory)
