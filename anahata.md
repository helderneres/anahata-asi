# Anahata ASI Maven Multi-Module Project

This document provides the high-level strategic overview and **rules that apply all modules** under the `anahata-ai-parent` project.

## 2. Core Modules

The project is divided into the following active modules:

1. **`anahata-asi-core`**: The foundational, model-agnostic framework. Contains all core interfaces, the domain model, and the tool-chain.
2. **`anahata-asi-gemini`**: The first provider-specific implementation, acting as an Adapter between the Google Gemini API and the core framework.
3. **`anahata-asi-swing`**: A reusable, provider-agnostic Swing UI component for building agentic workflows.
4. **`anahata-asi-cli`**: A draft command-line interface for interacting with ASI, semi discontinued. 
5. **`anahata-asi-standalone`**: A standalone Java application for running ASI outside of an IDE.
6. **`anahata-asi-web`**: The official ASI Portal and documentation hub.
7. **`anahata-asi-nb`**: The NetBeans integration module.
8. **`anahata-asi-yam`**: The "Yet Another Module" for creative and experimental agentic tools.

## 3. Strategic Documents

This project uses a set of key documents to guide development. For detailed information, please refer to the following:

- **`ci.md`**: Contains the CI/CD strategy, website deployment details, and Javadoc configuration notes.

## 4. Coding Principles

> [!NOTE]
> **Simplicity and Stability**
> The absolute priority for all development is **Simplicity and Stability** (or Stability through Simplicity). These principles rule above all others. 

- **Domain Driven Architecture (DDA)**: The entire multimodule project is based on DDA. Business logic and state transitions must reside in the domain model entities. Anything UI agnositc should be in `anahata-asi-core`. UI components of core in `anahata-asi-swing`.
- **Architectural Integrity**: We do not implement "dirty hacks" or workarounds to mask architectural flaws. If a design is broken, we fix the design.
- **JDK 25 Standard**: All modules are built and documented using **JDK 25**.
- **Engineering over Patching**: There is no requirement for backwards compatibility in this beta stage. Redesign flawed components instead of adding null checks.
- **Unified Content API**: Always prefer `message.addTextPart(text)` or `message.addBlobPart(...)` over direct instantiation of `TextPart` or `BlobPart`.
- **API Leanliness**: Avoid redundant signatures or secondary constructors. Keep the API lean and consistent.
- **Identity & Distributed Observability**: Message metadata must distinguish between the Logical Actor (`getFrom()`) and the Physical/Virtual Host (`getDevice()`).
- **No Reinventing Commons**: Use existing libraries like **Apache Commons Lang 3**.
- **Fail Fast**: Avoid defensive programming like redundant null checks for internal components. Let it fail so root causes can be fixed. 
- **No Method-Start Null Checks**: You are strictly forbidden from starting a method with a null check on parameters for the sake of defensive programming (e.g., `if (other == null) return;`). Let the JVM throw the NullPointerException so the caller can be corrected.
- **No Quietly Catching Exceptions**: You are strictly forbidden from catching exceptions and doing nothing. All exceptions should be logged. 
- **Clean Execution**: Do not use try-catch blocks inside `@AiTool` methods unless performing specific recovery. The framework handles exceptions automatically.
- **Mandatory Braces**: Always use curly braces `{}` for all control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `do`).
- **Logging Standard**: Use SLF4J (`@Slf4j`) for all logging. Never use `System.out.println()`.
- **Lombok Purity**: Rely on Lombok annotation processing; do not add explicit getters/setters for Lombok-managed fields.
- **Static should be static**: A method that does not use instance members should be made static.
- **Thread Awareness**: Toolkit methods can be invoked from background threads (during AI tool execution) or the Event Dispatch Thread (when triggered by user UI actions). The `SwingUtils` class contains convenience methods like `runInEDT` and `runInEDTAndWait` to help handle these transitions safely.
- **Reactive UI**: Use `PropertyChangeSource` and `EdtPropertyChangeListener` for UI-to-Domain bindings to ensure EDT execution.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: All toolkits and utilities must support Linux, Windows, and macOS via `OsUtils` and `SystemUtils`.
- **Standard Toolkit Method Order**: 
    1. `rebind()` (if needed)
    2. `getSystemInstructions()` (if needed)
    3. `populateMessage()` (if needed)
    4. `@AiTool` methods
    5. Public helper methods (if needed)
    6. Private implementation details (if needed)

## 5. Javadoc Standards

Comprehensive documentation is mandatory for this open-source project. Existing Javadoc and comments must never be removed.

- **Mandatory Visibility**: Javadoc is mandatory for **ALL** visibilities: `public`, `protected`, `package-private`, and `private`. If it can be Javadocced, it must be Javadocced.
- **ASI-Grade Quality**: Javadocs must be meaningful, providing architectural context, thread-safety notes, and domain-level significance. Avoid "lazy" or redundant Javadoc that just repeats the method name.
- **Override/Implementation Logic**: Every override or implementation must use the following pattern:
    `/** 
         {@inheritDoc} 
         <p>Describe the specific implementation logic here, explaining why and how this member is being overridden/implemented.</p> 
      */
     @Override'
- **Implementation Details**: For complex logic, use Javadoc to explain internal side effects and thread-safety considerations.

## 6. Lifecycle Management

- **The rebind() Hook**: The `rebind()` method is strictly reserved for recovering transient fields and re-establishing listeners after deserialization (e.g., from Kryo). It must never be called programmatically from business logic or constructors. Implementations must always call `super.rebind()` to ensure parent recovery.

## 7. Evolutionary Status

This project is in a pre-production state. We value architectural purity and long-term maintainability.

- **Architectural Rework**: If you identify a cleaner or more efficient design pattern, you are encouraged to propose and implement a rework of existing structures. Refactoring for clarity and future-proofing is preferred over applying patches to flawed designs.

## 8. Environment

- **Working Directory**: `~/.anahata/asi` (Standardized for V2).
